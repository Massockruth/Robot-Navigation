# Robot-Navigation
# Assignment Synopsis:
In this lab, students will develop and implement an algorithm to navigate the TI-RSLK
MAX through a predefined maze. Students may use any algorithm to accomplish this task.
All sensor packages available in the micro lab are available for the design. The only
restriction in the algorithm cannot include a student assisting RSLK by physically touching
it after it has been activated.
This is a two-week lab. In this first week, you will have an opportunity to test your
algorithm on the maze. It is recommended that you identify the RSLK you use during
testing, so that you can use the same one next week. During the second week of the lab, the
TA will allocate time for “practice” sessions and then you will have a minimum of two test
runs1. Your best score on your test runs will be used in your final grade. Your score will
be based on how far your RSLK made it through the maze. The TA will explain the out of
bound areas for the maze. Additionally, your RSLK must complete maze within the
specified time. Otherwise, your score will be based on the location of your RSLK when
time expired. A scoring bonus will be given to teams that make it all they way through the
maze in the shortest amount of time.
# Educational Objectives:
At the conclusion of this laboratory, a successful student will be able to:
1. Create an algorithm designed to navigate the TI-RSLK Max through a predefined
maze.
2. Remember what they learned in previous labs to develop a C or C++ code designed to
implement their algorithm.
3. Apply their programming code on the TI-RSLK.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of their implementation after demonstrating their design on
maze.
5. Analyze why or why not the RSLK successfully navigated through the maze.
